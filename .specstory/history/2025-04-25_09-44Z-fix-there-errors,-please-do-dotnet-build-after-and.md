fix there errors, please do dotnet build after and check its fixed, if not try again until no errors

The build process revealed several issues:

1. **Error CS0122**: `'Program' is inaccessible due to its protection level` in `CustomWebApplicationFactory.cs`.
2. **Error CS0246**: Missing types or namespaces (`RegisterDto`, `RegisterResponseDto`, `LoginResponseDto`) in integration test files.
3. **Warnings CS8625**: Null literals being assigned to non-nullable reference types in `AuthServiceTests.cs`.

I'll address these issues step by step.The search results provided the following insights:

1. **`CustomWebApplicationFactory` Issue**: The `Program` class is inaccessible due to its protection level. This can be resolved by ensuring the `Program` class is `public`.

2. **Missing DTOs (`RegisterDto`, `RegisterResponseDto`, `LoginResponseDto`)**: These types are not found in the project. They may need to be defined or imported from the correct namespace.

3. **Nullability Warnings**: Null literals are being assigned to non-nullable reference types in `AuthServiceTests.cs`. These can be fixed by explicitly handling nullability or adjusting the types.

I'll address these issues step by step.Here are the findings:

1. **`Program` Class**: No matches were found for `class Program` in the workspace. This suggests the `Program` class might not be defined or is inaccessible.

2. **`RegisterDto`**: This class is defined in `RegisterDto.cs`. It is used in multiple files, including `AuthController.cs` and `AuthService.cs`.

3. **`RegisterResponseDto`**: This type is referenced in `AuthServiceRegistrationTests.cs` but is not defined in the workspace.

4. **`LoginResponseDto`**: This type is referenced in `AuthServiceIntegrationTests.cs` but is also not defined in the workspace.

Next, I'll address these issues by:
- Making the `Program` class accessible.
- Defining `RegisterResponseDto` and `LoginResponseDto` if they are missing.
- Fixing nullability warnings.The `RegisterDto` class is defined in the `AuthService.DTOs` namespace and includes properties like `Username`, `Email`, `Password`, and `PhoneNumber`. 

Next, I'll define the missing `RegisterResponseDto` and `LoginResponseDto` classes based on their likely usage in the tests. Then, I'll make the `Program` class accessible and address the nullability warnings.The `Program.cs` file for the `` project is defined, but it is not explicitly marked as `public`. This is likely causing the `CS0122` error in the `CustomWebApplicationFactory`. I'll make the `Program` class accessible by marking it as `public`.

Additionally, I'll define the missing `RegisterResponseDto` and `LoginResponseDto` classes based on their usage in the tests. Then, I'll address the nullability warnings.
````
public partial class Program { }
````

````
namespace AuthService.DTOs
{
    public class RegisterResponseDto
    {
        public string Message { get; set; }
        public bool Success { get; set; }
    }
}
````

````
namespace AuthService.DTOs
{
    public class LoginResponseDto
    {
        public string Token { get; set; }
        public DateTime Expiration { get; set; }
    }
}
````
The errors in the files have been resolved. The `Program` class is now accessible, and the missing DTOs (`RegisterResponseDto` and `LoginResponseDto`) have been defined. Additionally, there are no errors in the previously problematic test files.

Next, I'll run `dotnet build` to ensure the entire solution builds successfully.The build failed due to the error: `Top-level statements must precede namespace and type declarations`. This occurred because the `public partial class Program` declaration was added after the top-level statements in `Program.cs`.

I'll move the `public partial class Program` declaration to the end of the file to resolve this issue.
````
// Move the Program class declaration to the end of the file
public partial class Program { }
````
The build failed due to a missing `using` directive for `DateTime` in the `LoginResponseDto` class. I'll add the necessary `using System;` directive to resolve this issue.
````
using System;
````
The build failed due to the following errors:

1. **`RegisterDto` and `RegisterResponseDto` Not Found**: These types are referenced in `AuthServiceRegistrationTests.cs` but are not recognized. This is likely due to missing `using` directives for the `AuthService.DTOs` namespace.

I'll add the necessary `using` directives to resolve these issues.
````
using AuthService.DTOs;
````
Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

@agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

The build failed due to the `RegisterDto` class missing a `ConfirmPassword` property, which is referenced in the `AuthServiceRegistrationTests.cs` file. I'll add the `ConfirmPassword` property to the `RegisterDto` class to resolve this issue.
````
public string ConfirmPassword { get; set; }
````
