write a yml that should 100% work

_**Assistant**_

To ensure the YAML file works perfectly, I'll make the following improvements:
1. Add a step to set up .NET.
2. Include a step to restore dependencies.
3. Add a step to run tests.
4. Ensure the artifact upload step is meaningful.

I'll update the file accordingly.
````
name: .NET CI Workflow

  push:
    branches:
      - main

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Setup .NET
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
      with:
        dotnet-version: '8.0.x'

    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: dotnet restore

    - name: Build the project
      run: dotnet build --no-restore --configuration Release

    - name: Run tests
      run: dotnet test --no-build --configuration Release --logger "trx;LogFileName=test_results.trx"

    - name: Upload test results
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: test-results
        path: '**/*.trx'

The YAML file has been added to the specified location with a complete CI workflow for a .NET project. Let me know if you need further adjustments or additional workflows!
