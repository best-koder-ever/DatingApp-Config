## 🛠️ **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Install GitHub CLI (if not installed):**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt install gh

# Or download from: https://github.com/cli/cli/releases
```

### **2. Authenticate with GitHub:**
```bash
gh auth login
# Choose: GitHub.com > HTTPS > Yes (git credential helper) > Login with browser
```

### **3. Test the script:**
```bash
cd /home/m/development/DatingApp
./github_repo_toggle.sh status
```

---

## 🎯 **How to Use the Toggle Script**

### **📊 Check Current Status:**
```bash
./github_repo_toggle.sh status
```
Shows all your repos and their current visibility.

### **🚀 Enable Unlimited GitHub Actions:**
```bash
./github_repo_toggle.sh public
```
- Makes ALL your repos public
- Enables unlimited GitHub Actions minutes
- Perfect for development/testing phases

### **🔒 Make Repos Private Again:**
```bash
./github_repo_toggle.sh private
```
- Makes ALL your repos private  
- Returns to 2,000 minute limit
- Good for production/sensitive code

---

## 📈 **Strategic Usage Patterns**

### **🔥 Development Phase (Recommended):**
```bash
# Start development with unlimited Actions
./github_repo_toggle.sh public

# Develop with unlimited CI/CD
git push origin main  # ✅ FREE unlimited runs!
git push origin main  # ✅ FREE unlimited runs!
git push origin main  # ✅ FREE unlimited runs!

# When ready for production:
./github_repo_toggle.sh private
```

### **💰 Cost Comparison:**
```bash
# Private repo development (expensive):
100 pushes × 45 minutes = 4,500 minutes
Cost: (4,500 - 2,000) × $0.008 = $20/month

# Public repo development (FREE):
100 pushes × 45 minutes = 4,500 minutes  
Cost: $0 (unlimited!)

# Savings: $20/month = $240/year! 💰
```

### **🎛️ Hybrid Strategy:**
```bash
# Daily development workflow:
./github_repo_toggle.sh public    # Morning: Enable unlimited Actions
# ... develop all day with unlimited CI/CD
./github_repo_toggle.sh private   # Evening: Make private again

# Cost: $0 for development, private when not coding
```

## 🛡️ **Security Considerations**

### **✅ Safe to Make Public:**
- **Open source projects** (always public anyway)
- **Learning/demo projects** (great for portfolio!)
- **Development phases** (before sensitive data)
- **Template/starter projects**

### **⚠️ Keep Private:**
- **Production apps** with real users
- **Code with API keys/secrets** 
- **Proprietary business logic**
- **Client/customer projects**

### **🔐 Best Practices:**
```bash
# Always check what's in your repos before making public:
./github_repo_toggle.sh status

# Remove sensitive data before going public:
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path/to/sensitive/file' \
--prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Use environment variables for secrets (not hardcoded)
```

## 🚀 **Your Dating App Strategy**

### **Current Situation:**
- 5 microservices + Flutter app + documentation
- ~45 minutes per CI/CD run
- Likely 2,000-4,000 minutes/month usage

### **💡 Recommended Approach:**

#### **Phase 1: Development (Public)**
```bash
# Enable unlimited Actions for development:
./github_repo_toggle.sh public

# Benefits:
# - Unlimited CI/CD runs
# - Perfect for rapid development  
# - Great portfolio showcase
# - No billing worries
```

#### **Phase 2: Production Prep (Selective)**
```bash
# Make sensitive repos private:
gh repo edit best-koder-ever/mobile_dejtingapp --visibility private
# Keep infrastructure repos public if no secrets

# Benefits:
# - Core app is private
# - Still get some free Actions on public repos
# - Hybrid approach
```

#### **Phase 3: Production (Private)**
```bash
# When launching with real users:
./github_repo_toggle.sh private

# Set up proper budget controls:
# GitHub Settings > Billing > Spending limit: $20/month
```

## 🎯 **Advanced Usage Examples**

### **🔄 Automated Daily Toggle:**
```bash
# Create a cron job for automatic toggling:
# Edit crontab: crontab -e

# Make public at 9 AM (start of workday):
0 9 * * 1-5 /home/m/development/DatingApp/github_repo_toggle.sh public

# Make private at 6 PM (end of workday):  
0 18 * * 1-5 /home/m/development/DatingApp/github_repo_toggle.sh private
```

### **📊 Usage Monitoring:**
```bash
# Create a script to monitor your Actions usage:
cat > check_actions_usage.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "Checking GitHub Actions usage..."
gh api /user/settings/billing/actions
EOF

chmod +x check_actions_usage.sh
```

### **🎛️ Selective Repository Toggle:**
```bash
# Modify the script for specific repos only:
# Edit github_repo_toggle.sh and add repo filtering:

REPOS_TO_TOGGLE=("mobile_dejtingapp" "auth-service" "matchmaking-service")
# Only toggle repos in this array
```
