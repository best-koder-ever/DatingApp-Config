## 💸 **Cost Comparison**

### **Current (All Private) - EXPENSIVE:**
```
Monthly Development Scenario:
- 60 commits across all repos = 60 × 45 min = 2,700 minutes
- Overage: 2,700 - 2,000 = 700 minutes
- Cost: 700 × $0.008 = $5.60/month

Heavy Development Scenario:  
- 120 commits across all repos = 120 × 45 min = 5,400 minutes
- Overage: 5,400 - 2,000 = 3,400 minutes  
- Cost: 3,400 × $0.008 = $27.20/month

Annual Cost: $5.60 × 12 = $67/year to $326/year
```

### **New Strategy (All Public) - FREE:**
```
ANY Development Scenario:
- 1000+ commits across all repos = UNLIMITED minutes
- Overage: 0 minutes
- Cost: $0/month

Annual Cost: $0/year
